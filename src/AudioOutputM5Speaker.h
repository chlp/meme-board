// Bridges ESP8266Audio to M5Unified Speaker using triple-buffered stereo output.
//
// Why three buffers?  M5Unified Speaker holds a 2-slot queue per channel
// (current + next wav_info_t).  At any instant the speaker is reading from
// one buffer (current) and the other (next) is queued.  If we used only two
// buffers — like the obvious double-buffer pattern — the next `playRaw` call
// would have to overwrite the buffer that the speaker is still draining via
// DMA, which corrupts the samples and is heard as a constant hiss / static
// underneath the music.  Speaker_Class.hpp itself says: "If you want to use
// the data generated at runtime, you can either have three buffers and use
// them in sequence, or have two buffers and use them alternately, then split
// them in half and call playRaw twice."  We take the three-buffer route
// (same approach AdvanceOS uses on the same hardware).
//
// Why stereo?  Mixing L+R down to mono before sending it to the speaker
// works, but it forces the speaker to up-convert mono → stereo internally
// and the extra averaging in `ConsumeSample` is wasted work.  Sending the
// stereo pair untouched lets the speaker driver play it directly.
//
// Abort handling: stopAudio() / startMp3() must be able to interrupt a
// pending `playRaw` quickly so the audio task releases the mutex.  When the
// abort flag is set, `flushBuffer` skips the blocking call and simply drops
// the half-filled buffer.  See audio.cpp for the threading details.
